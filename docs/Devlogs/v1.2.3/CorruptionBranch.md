## Corruption

## Factions

On province screen display the most powerful local party similarly to EU4 estate.

When local admin efficiency is <100% nation fails to collect some taxes.

10% of these taxes are paid to party coffers (bribes to local parteigenosse).

With this money, parties

1) Industry in province Y supports ideology Z
2) Investors X in province Y pay some 10% of uncollected taxes into party Z coffers
3) Party Z spends that money to ask for concessions to help industry X in province Y

Potential types of concessions:
1. Party pays into treasury for a decrease of local taxes
2. Party asks for money in exchange for more effective local bureaucrats

## Autonomy

Show province nationalism on province screen.

While province has nationalism, bureaucrats have -50% to tax collection efficiency. Justification: newly acquired land usually wasn't properly integrated into countries for quite a long time. Take a look at Alsace-Lorraine, for example.

While bureaucrats are members of a rebel faction, they don't collect taxes.
